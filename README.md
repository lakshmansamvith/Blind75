Welcome to my LeetCode Solutions repository! Here, you will find my solutions to various LeetCode problems, including the LeetCode 75, Blind 75, and NeetCode 150 lists. These lists consist of popular and frequently asked coding questions that are essential for interview preparation.

<h2>I do not prefer writing one liners using LINQ or other resources unless necessary, I find it necessary that the code I write should be self explanatory.</h2>

<h3>LeetCode 75</h3>

The LeetCode 75 list comprises 75 carefully selected coding questions that cover a wide range of data structures and algorithms. These problems are often encountered during technical interviews, and mastering them is crucial for success. In this repository, you will find my solutions to each of these problems, along with explanations and time/space complexity analysis.

<h3>Blind 75</h3>
The Blind 75 list consists of 75 coding questions that are commonly asked by top tech companies during their interview processes. These questions are specifically designed to test problem-solving skills, algorithmic thinking, and knowledge of fundamental data structures. I have solved each problem from this list and documented my solutions in this repository, providing clear explanations and code implementations.

<h3>NeetCode 150</h3>
<h6>Note:I haven't done Neetcode solutions yet, I plan to go through them.</h6>
The NeetCode 150 list is a curated collection of 150 LeetCode problems that offer a deeper understanding of advanced data structures and algorithms. These questions are often considered challenging and require a strong grasp of core programming concepts. In this repository, you will find my solutions to the NeetCode 150 problems, accompanied by detailed explanations and optimized code implementations.

Other LeetCode Solutions
In addition to the LeetCode 75, Blind 75, and NeetCode 150 lists, I have solved many other LeetCode problems that cover a wide range of difficulty levels and topics. My goal is to continuously enhance my problem-solving skills and algorithmic thinking by tackling diverse coding challenges. You will find my solutions to these problems in this repository as well.

Feel free to explore the repository and navigate through different folders to find the specific problem solutions you are interested in. Each solution is well-documented and includes the problem statement, approach explanation, and code implementation. I hope my solutions can be a valuable resource for your own LeetCode journey and assist you in your technical interview preparations.

Happy coding!
